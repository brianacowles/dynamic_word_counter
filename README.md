Word counter that allows the user to select parameters for easier estimations. 

In high school, my favorite English teacher had us count the words in our essays a very specific way. This made most word counters practically useless, and I would have to resort to counting the words by hand. This was incredibly tedious. Hopefully, this tool will make estimating future students essay length easier.

If you have any parameter requests, please create an issue! I'd be happy to add more parameters.
